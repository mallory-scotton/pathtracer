#  Raytracer

## üöÄ Project Overview

GLSL-based path tracer developed as a 2nd year student project at EPITECH. This renderer implements physically-based rendering techniques within fragment shaders, allowing for high-quality image synthesis directly on the GPU.

Built on the foundation of proven ray tracing methodologies, this project serves both as an educational exploration of modern rendering techniques and a practical implementation of computer graphics theory. The renderer efficiently balances visual fidelity with performance constraints, making advanced lighting simulation accessible within an academic context.

The implementation draws inspiration from established rendering techniques while adapting them to the constraints and opportunities of GLSL shader programming. This approach allows for the exploration of complex lighting phenomena while maintaining interactive feedback during development.

This project builds upon knowledge gained in core computer science fundamentals and extends it into specialized graphics programming domains, demonstrating the practical application of algorithms and data structures in visual computing.
